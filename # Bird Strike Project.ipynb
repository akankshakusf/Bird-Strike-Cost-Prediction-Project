Use this data set to see if you can predict the cost of a bird strike (i.e., the `Total Cost` column in the data set) based on the attributes of the incident. This is important because this model can make a cost prediction as soon as a bird strike incident happens."

A higher ratio could indicate significant damage to the aircraft.
